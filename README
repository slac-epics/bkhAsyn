This is a support module for Beckhoff BK**** Modbus/TCP Bus Couplers and Bus Terminals.
It has been tested extensively with BK9000 couplers and many different bus terminals,
and *should* support all analog and digital I/O modules.
It also supports multiple couplers per IOC.

Configuring a new IOC involves two major steps:
1. Add config commands to st.cmd file.
2. Create database file(s).  For this you can use the db files from this support module,
or create your own.

This module contains an example IOC for a setup with ADCs, a DAC, Digital Input/Output,
and Temperature modules.

Note: To prevent the I/O from timimg out, one should set the "Watchdog Timeout" to zero.
This can be done with the records provided in this module, or when configuring your bus 
coupler's network settings using KS2000.

See the example IOC included in this module for help with IOC configuration.
