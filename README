This is a support module for Beckhoff Bus Couplers and Bus Terminals, 
created by Zen Szalata.
It has been tested successfully with BK9000 couplers and many different bus terminals.

Configuring a new IOC involves two major steps:
1. Add config commands to st.cmd file.
2. Create database file(s).  For this you can use the db files from this support module, 
or create your own.

This module contains an example IOC for a setup with ADCs, a DAC, Digital Input/Output, 
and Temperature modules.

Note: when configuring your bus coupler's network settings,
it is wise to set the "Watchdog Timeout" to zero, otherwise the I/O might
time out.  It can also be set via channel access, with the following PV:
$(P):900W_REG22
